Description: Circumvent IP address blocking using domain fronting - client browser helper
 meek is a pluggable transport that uses HTTP for carrying bytes and TLS for
 obfuscation. Traffic is relayed through a third-party server that is hard to
 block, for example a 窶気DN. It uses a trick called "domain fronting" to talk to
 a Tor relay while appearing to talk to another domain.
 .
 This package contains an extension that lets external programs control the
 browser to make outgoing connections that look like normal web browsing
 traffic. Because it has a very specific use-case and completely changes the
 behaviour of the browser, it is not installed as a system-level extension.
 Instead, one should use the provided meek-browser-helper program, or else one
 may install the extension into a specific browser profile manually.

Description: Circumvent IP address blocking using domain fronting - client tools
 meek is a pluggable transport that uses HTTP for carrying bytes and TLS for
 obfuscation. Traffic is relayed through a third-party server that is hard to
 block, for example a 窶気DN. It uses a trick called "domain fronting" to talk to
 a Tor relay while appearing to talk to another domain.
 .
 This package contains client programs that enables censored Tor users to
 circumvent censorship. It includes a bare Tor client transport plugin, and a
 wrapper program that combines it with meek-http-helper to make outgoing
 traffic look more realistic.

Description: Circumvent IP address blocking using domain fronting - server transport plugin
 meek is a pluggable transport that uses HTTP for carrying bytes and TLS for
 obfuscation. Traffic is relayed through a third-party server that is hard to
 block, for example a 窶気DN. It uses a trick called "domain fronting" to talk to
 a Tor relay while appearing to talk to another domain.
 .
 This package contains a server transport plugin that accepts incoming meek
 connections that look like the HTTP protocol, proxied by reflectors originally
 from meek clients.

Description: Circumvent IP address blocking using domain fronting - reflector utilities
 meek is a pluggable transport that uses HTTP for carrying bytes and TLS for
 obfuscation. Traffic is relayed through a third-party server that is hard to
 block, for example a 窶気DN. It uses a trick called "domain fronting" to talk to
 a Tor relay while appearing to talk to another domain.
 .
 This package contains code and tools to be installed on various types of web
 servers that can support "domain fronting", that enable them to be used by
 meek tor clients to connect with meek tor relays.
